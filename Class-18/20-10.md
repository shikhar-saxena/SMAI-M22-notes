# Linear Model

$$
y = w_0 + \sum_{i=1}^d w_i x_i = w^T x + w_0
$$

## One neuron

- $z=w^T x$
- $y = f(z)$


$f$ is a step function and is mostly non-linear.

## Matrix representation (for MLP)

$$X \xrightarrow{W} W^T X \longrightarrow Z \xrightarrow{f(Z)} Y$$

## Multi-class classification

Multiple outputs in the output layer. Class 1 will have 1 (for class1 output) and 0 for the other class outputs.
