# Parameter Estimation

## Assumption

- Training samples
  - We know which class each sample belongs to 
  - Classes are mutually exclusive. A sample can't have more than one class
- Samples in $D_i$ does not influence $P(X | \omega_j) \; i \neq j$ 
  - $D_i$ is the class for training set.
- Samples are iid
  - What does independence of samples even mean?
    - Drawing one sample is independent of the other sample
- We know the function / form of $P(X | \omega_i)$ (density function).
  - Unknowns are parameters of the distribution
 
### Problem

Given $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\} \in \omega_i$

Estimate $\theta$ of $p(x | \theta)$

Using the independent assumption,

$$p(D | \theta) = \prod_{k=1}^n p(x_i | \theta)$$

### Maximum likelihood Estimate (MLE)

\begin{align*}
\hat{\theta}_{MLE} &= \text{arg max}_\theta \ p(D | \theta) \\
&= \text{arg max}_\theta \text{ ln } p(D| \theta) \quad \text{logarithm for convenience}
\end{align*}

Take derivative of $\text{ln } p(D | \theta)$ and set it to zero (for maximum value).
