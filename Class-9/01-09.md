# SVM revisited

**Support Vectors**: Data points closer to the boundary.

- Soft Margin SVM
  - Some outliners are there so boundary is not that clear. So we maintain a soft margin for such cases 
- Transductive SVM
  - Many points with no annotation (class label).
  - We still use them to determine the density of the data.
  - Our boundary will exist at the low density region between the high density regions.
- Non-linear SVM
  - Kernelization

# Kernel space

For kNN

- $\|x_i - x_j\|^2 = \langle x_i, x_i \rangle + \langle x_j, x_j \rangle - 2 \langle x_i, x_j \rangle$

- kernel PCA
