# Decision Tree

- [Reference](https://towardsdatascience.com/decision-tree-overview-with-no-maths-66b256281e2b)

- Decision boundaries are axis parallel.
  - You might notice that the decision boundaries made by a decision tree are parallel to the axis, and thatâ€™s how they always are: Parallel to the axis. The reason for this is that a Decision tree splits the data based on a feature value and this value would remain constant throughout for one decision boundary e.g., x=2 or y=3 where x and y are two different features.
- Decision trees are extremely efficient.
