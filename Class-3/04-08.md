# Class 3

Raw Data -> Feature extraction -> Feature Vector -> Feature space

- $\omega$: classes in the feature space
- $y$: output of the pipeline

Process of learning is learning the separator between the classes.

We saw kNN (which tried to learn without learning the decision boundary).

## Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE)

Find $P(x | \omega)$ from $P(\omega | x)$ (Bayes' rule)
And assign the class with MLE to $x$.

even for continous random variable $X$, this will hold as follows:

$$
P(\omega_i | x) = \frac{p(x| \omega_i)}{p(x|\omega_1) + p(x| \omega_2)}
$$
Since, we are using Normal Distribution for height (pdf) it also arises in data that someone might have -ve height.

But we ignore such errors. 


Check Bayes' Terminology
- belief
- likelihood
- prior
